Exercise 3 - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Every Vehicle in this module must honor the same contract (see Track's
own docstring/engine.track.Racer): move() always leaves position >= its
previous value, and move() never raises. Track relies on this contract
to run any race safely -- anything that can't honor it should not be a
Vehicle.

UnreliableCar below breaks that contract on purpose: run it a few times
and watch it either crash the race or roll backwards.

YOUR TASK: redesign UnreliableCar's move() so "being unreliable" no
longer violates the contract. Model unreliability as something the
contract allows -- for example, some ticks it simply does not advance
(stays exactly where it is) -- instead of raising or moving backwards.
Do not change the Vehicle base class or Track.

Run it to see the current (broken) behavior:
    python -m exercises.ex3_lsp

    pytest tests/test_ex3_lsp.py -v
