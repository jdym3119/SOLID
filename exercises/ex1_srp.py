Exercise 1 - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

PROBLEM: the Car class below does three unrelated jobs at once:
  1. Tracks its own race state (name, speed, position).
  2. Prints its own status line to the console on every move.
  3. Appends a line to a results log on disk on every move.

That is three different reasons for Car to change (a new state field, a
new print format, a new log format) -- exactly what SRP says a class
should not have.

YOUR TASK:
  1. Strip Car down so it ONLY tracks state and knows how to move itself.
     Remove the print() and the file-writing from move().
  2. Write a new `RaceLogger` class, responsible for recording race
     results and saving them to disk, completely independent of Car:
       - record(tick, racers): remember each racer's position for this tick
       - save(path="race_log.txt"): write everything recorded so far to disk
       - an `entries` property returning the recorded entries as a list of str
  3. Wire it together in main(): pass `logger.record` as the `on_tick`
     callback to `Track.run(...)`, then call `logger.save()` once the
     race finishes.

Run it to see (and hear silence from) your fix:
    python -m exercises.ex1_srp
